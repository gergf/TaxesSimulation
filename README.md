# Taxes Simulation
### Using netLogo v.6

Have you ever asked yourself why do we have to pay taxes? 
Wouldn't we live better in a world without taxes? 
I work harder than him, why do I have to pay more? 

Well, I've build a little simulation of a system with the goal of to convince myself 
that we live better paying our taxes (Luckily, my conclusions are that taxes are a good thing).

This simulation is very crude, so please take care of what conclusions that you extract, 
because the reality is far far away of the system that I have implemmented. 

Here we have a picture of how the tool looks.

You're free to use this simulation as you want, I only ask you the leave a reference 
to this repository. (-:
